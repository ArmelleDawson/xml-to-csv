Usage: java -jar xml2csv-*.jar --columns <columns> --input <file> --output <file>

General command line switches:

--columns <columns>
    List of columns that should be output to the CSV file. These names must
    correspond to the element names within the item element.
--input <file>
    Path to the input XML file.
--output <file>
    Path to the output CSV file. Output file content is always in UTF-8 encoding.

Filtering rows:

--filter-column <name>
    Column on which the filter should be applied. When specifying filter command
    line switches, you must use this switch as the first one as it initializes
    new filter. You can specify more filters, each one beginning with this
    switch. You can filter the rows even on columns that are not part of the
    output.
..filter.values <file>
    Path to file containing values that the filter should use. Empty rows are
    added to the values too.
--filter-exclude
    Excludes all rows where the column value matches one of the specified values.
--filter-include
    Includes all rows where the column value matches one of the specified values.
    This is the default behavior if --filter-exclude|--filter-include is not
    specified.
